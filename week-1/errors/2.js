// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// ANSWER //

/*  When we try to use cityOfBirth in the console.log statement, it has not been declared yet, which results in a ReferenceError.

So we declare it first then we log it
*/
