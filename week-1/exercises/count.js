let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//SOLUTION
//count = count + 1 means take the current value of count, add 1 to it, and store the result back into the count variable.

//After line 3, count now holds the value 1.
