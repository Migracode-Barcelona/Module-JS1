let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// ANSWER //
/*
In line 3, the = sign updates the value of count. It takes the current value of count, adds 1 to it, and then stores the new value back in count. So, count changes from 0 to 1.
